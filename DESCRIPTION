Description: This package contains several programs to import c++ code as well 
  as R programs already created into one complete package.
  my_hclust takes 2 arguments (data, and clusters desired)
  data must be a matrix and clusters must be an int
Usage:rcpp_matrix(), add_two(integer),  read_data(matrix/vector), 
  my_kmenas_cpp(matrix, integer)
Arguments: rcpp_matrix() takes no arguments and returns a numeric vector 
  redimensioned into a 2x2 matrix with cpp indexing
  add_two() takes a single integer and adds 2 to it, returning an arma:vector
  with a single element
  read_data() takes a single matrix or arma::mat argument and returns the same
  as an arma::mat object
  my_kmenas_cpp() takes two arguments, a data set with no labels and the number
  of clusters it should be seporated into.
